---

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Test Real-Time Collaboration (10 minutes)
Follow **TESTING_GUIDE.md** to:
- Open two tabs/browsers
- Create and join a session
- Test all drawing tools
- Verify active users sync
- Check browser console for errors

### 2. Deploy Online (30-60 minutes)
Follow **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** to:

#### Backend Deployment (Railway/Render):
1. Sign up for Railway.app or Render.com
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set environment variables (PORT, MONGO_URI)
4. Deploy with one click
5. Get your backend URL (e.g., `https://stromboard-api.railway.app`)

#### Frontend Deployment (Vercel/Netlify):
1. Update `frontend/session.js` with production backend URL
2. Sign up for Vercel.com or Netlify.com
3. Import your repository
4. Deploy frontend
5. Get your frontend URL (e.g., `https://stromboard.vercel.app`)

#### Final Configuration:
1. Update backend CORS with your frontend URL
2. Whitelist backend IP in MongoDB Atlas
3. Test deployed version with two devices
4. Share your Stromboard with the world! 🌍

## 🎯 How It Works

### Real-Time Flow:

```
User 1 draws on canvas
    ↓
Frontend emits 'draw-action' via Socket.IO
    ↓
Backend receives event
    ↓
Backend broadcasts to all users in session (except sender)
    ↓
User 2's frontend receives 'draw-action'
    ↓
User 2's canvas updates with stroke
    ↓
✨ Real-time collaboration!
```

### Socket.IO Events:

**Client → Server:**
- `join-session` - Join a room with userName and avatar
- `draw-action` - Send drawing stroke data
- `clear-canvas` - Clear canvas for all users
- `add-text` - Add text element
- `cursor-move` - Share cursor position
- `undo-action` / `redo-action` - History sync

**Server → Client:**
- `users-update` - Broadcast active users list
- `draw-action` - Receive drawings from others
- `clear-canvas` - Canvas cleared by another user
- `add-text` - Text added by another user
